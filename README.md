Understanding CBD: A Brief Overview
CBD, short for cannabidiol, is a compound found in hemp plants. Unlike THC, which is responsible for the psychoactive effects of cannabis, CBD is non-psychoactive. It interacts with the body’s endocannabinoid system (ECS), which regulates essential functions like mood, sleep, and pain.

Bliss Roots CBD Gummies deliver CBD in a convenient, pre-measured form, ensuring consistent results with every use. This makes them an excellent choice for anyone new to CBD or those who prefer a straightforward, no-fuss method of consumption.
